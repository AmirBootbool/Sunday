A final team-project in the Elevation full-stack bootcamp.

In order to integarte and apply some of the tools and skills we had earned during this bootcamp,
we have chosen to build an app that will mimic some of MONDAY.COM app's features,
while including some other  features such as built-in chat.

Main tools used in this project:

Back End - Node.js:
  Express Server
  Socket.io
  Random Avatar API
  Nodemailer
  Cryptography â€“ DES with salts

DB:
  MySQL

front end:
  React
  MobX State Manager
  Material UI
  Rc-Progress (Analysis)
  
  
  
  Cheers !
